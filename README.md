# AVLtrees
upgraded version of BinarySearchTrees

    Add rotations (balancing of the tree) to your implementation from the BinarySearchTrees
    Add a function that prints the content of a tree (values stored in nodes) using postorder traversal
    Demonstrate that your program works correctly (use case) by:
        Printing the content of the tree from BinarySearchTrees
        Adding element(s) that make(s) this tree unbalanced
        Rebalancing the tree
        Printing the content of the tree
